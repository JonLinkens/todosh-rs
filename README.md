Open tasks stored in local `task.todo` file, with completed tasks stored in `completed.todo`.  
<br/>

I made this for personal use because I find myself in Terminal so often that it made sense to keep track of tasks in it, rather than having to tab out to another program to see them. It also means that tasks are stored alongside projects. It was also a good opportunity to have a go at writing some Rust.  
<br/> 
This is by no means well written, in fact it is probably terribly writtenâ€”but it works for my needs.
